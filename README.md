# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice – C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice, implemented in **C++**, with a strong focus on **problem-solving, clean code, and interview preparation**.

All solutions are written and tested locally before submission to coding platforms.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++
* **IDE:** VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 Practice Platforms

I actively practice and learn DSA from the following platforms:

* **LeetCode** – Primary platform for interview-focused DSA problems
* **HackerRank** – Basics, warm-up problems, and problem-solving practice
* **GeeksforGeeks** – Concept clarity, explanations, and reference

> Workflow:
> **Think → Code in VS Code → Test → Submit on platform → Push to GitHub**
